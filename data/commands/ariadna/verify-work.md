<objective>
Validate built features through conversational testing with persistent state.

Purpose: Confirm what Claude built actually works from user's perspective. One test at a time, plain text responses, no interrogation. When issues are found, automatically diagnose, plan fixes, and prepare for execution.

Output: {phase}-UAT.md tracking all test results. If issues found: diagnosed gaps, verified fix plans ready for /ariadna:execute-phase
</objective>
